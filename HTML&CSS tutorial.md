<dt>Webpage</dt> <dd> A document written in HTML.</dd>

# HTML basics
## HTML syntax
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
```
HyperText            means that it uses the HTTP part of the Internet
Markup               means the code you write is annotated with keywords
Language             means it can be read by both a human and a computer
```
What you see in 
```
angle brackets < and > 
```
are HTML tags. They define where something starts and where it ends.

Each of them carry a specific meaning. In this case, p stands for paragraph.
They usually go in pairs:
```
the opening tag <p> defines the start of the paragraph
the closing tag </p> defines its end
```
The only difference between an opening and closing tag is the slash / that precedes the name of the tag.

##### Where to write HTML
Youâ€™ve probably come across *simple text files*, those that have a .txt extension.
For such a text file to become an HTML document (instead of a text document), you need to use an *.html extension*.

Remember:
```
use a text editor like Notepad++ to create HTML documents
use a browser like Firefox to open HTML documents
```
