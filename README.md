## Basic syntax
### headings

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase

```
Markdown                       HTML:
# Heading level 1              <h1> Heading level 1</h1>
```

Alternate Syntax:

Alternatively, on the line below the text, add *any number* of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

```
Heading level 1             
===============            <h1>Heading level 1</h1>

Heading level 2
---------------            <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
```
<h3> Paragraphs </h3>

<p>To create paragraphs, use a *blank line* to separate one or more lines of text.</p>
 You should not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs

```
MarkDown:                           HTML
I really like using Markdown.       <p>I really like using Markdown.</p>
(blank line)
```
### line breaks
To create a line break (),    
```
<br>
```
end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
### Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.
```
<strong> </strong>                   **text**
<em> </em>                           *text*
<strong><em> </em></strong>          ***text***
```
### Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
```
> text

> text
>
> paragraph
```
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest
```
>
>>
>>>
```
Blockquotes with Other Elements
```
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

### List
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

#### Ordered Lists
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item	
<ol>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
<li>Third item</li>
<li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>
```
#### Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add 
```
dashes (-), 
asterisks (*), or 
plus signs (+) 
```
in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
